// REQUIREMENTS
// If no parameter is given in the URL, the page must display one or more
//     search boxes to let the user search for a movie and for an actor. (For
//     an actor/actress, you should examine first/last name, and for a movie,
//     you should examine title.)
// If (a set of) keyword(s) are provided as the actor parameter of the URL, the
//     page must return the list of actors whose first or last name contains
//     the keyword(s). Clicking on each movie must lead to the corresponding
//     actor page.
// If (a set of) keyword(s) are provided as the movie parameter of the URL, the
//     page must return the list of movies whose title contains the keyword(s).
//     Clicking on each actor must lead to the corresponding movie page.
// The search page should support multi-word search, such as “Tom Hanks,” and
//     be case-insensitive. For multi-word search, interpret space as “AND”.
//     That is, return all actors that contain “Tom” AND “Hanks” in their first
//     or last name columns. To support case-insensitive search, you can apply
//     the LOWER() function to both the column (to be searched in) and the
//     string (that you search for).
